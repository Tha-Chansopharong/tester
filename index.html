            Unicode has a huge number of symbols, and so we're able to create
            other things like a wingdings translator too. Also if you're looking

            Mildly off topic, but you might also be interested in Facebook
            emojis - that's a massive searchable list of all the emojis that you
            can use in your Facebook posts and chat. And actually, I made an üêå
            Emoji Translator üé≤ which you might like. If there's anything that I
            can do to improve this online fancy generator thing (e.g. by adding
            other font styles that you've found), then please let me know in the
            suggestions box! If you've some found new beautiful fonts that can
            be copy-pasted and that aren't in this generator, please share them
            below as well. Thanks!

            created when the browser tries to create a fancy letter. This doesn't
            mean there's an error with this translator, it just means the

            After generating your fancy text symbols, you can copy and paste the
            "fonts" to most websites and text processors. You could use it to
            generate a fancy Agario name (yep, weird text in agario is probably
            generated using a fancy text ).
